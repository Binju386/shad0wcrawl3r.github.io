                    Technology as we know it has changed severely than how it was known to be. A few dacades ago computers used to be as large as an entire room. The cost of creation and maintenance would be the very expensive. But today, computers an be found as small as a medicine pill. The cost of production also has lowered by a hunge amount allowing it to be placed into every single little device. Now, we can find computers in almost every part of our lives.

                    Today, almost everyone has their lives greately influenced by computers. Some of the widely accepted example of these influences can be regared as social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. Almost everyone in the world has a Facebook account. According to <a href="https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/">Zephoria</a> the number of monthly active users in Facebook are 2.3 Billion and the number of daily active users in Facebook are 1.56 billion. This shows that around 30.5% of the population engages in Facebook monthly. The number of facebook accounts created are much more than this amount. It is estimated that around 90% of the revenue collected by facebook amounts from Ads.

                    In case of my personal life, not a single hour goes by where I am not influenced by the computers around me. While at home, I have my laptop and my desktop open almost all the time(other than the time I am sleeping). While in transit from one place to other, I always listen to music from my phone. While in college, I am an IT student, so almost every single time, I am using my laptop or my phone, either to do some job or to record what my teachers have spoken so that I can revise it afterwards. I guess, the only time that I dont seem to use any of the technology of today is while I am in the bath. Sometimes even that is violated as I tend to listen to music quite a lot.

                    I guess we can now draw a cnclusion that the technology of today has greately influenced our lives. Most people can't even stay idle without using the technological advancements. So much overuse of these devices forces us to reconsider if the technological advancements that we have made today are for the betterment of the humankind or for the worse.
